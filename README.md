**Course Link:** https://www.coursera.org/learn/developing-applications-with-sql-databases-and-django

### What you'll learn
- Explain what a database is and create an entity relationship data model for a relational database.
- Compose SQL queries to insert, select, update, and delete data in a database.
- Use Django ORM to build object-oriented databases.
- Integrate Bootstrap into your Django template and build interactive web pages.

### There are 5 modules in this course
Working with databases is a key skill for developers, especially those in Back-End, Full Stack, and DevOps roles. This course will teach you the fundamentals of relational databases and how to access them from your applications.  

Some of the essential application development tasks include accessing, processing, and presenting data. Data is stored in various databases, either on-premise or on the cloud, and developers will need to learn how to talk to them via programming languages. 

In this course, you’ll learn about foundational database concepts, and basics of SQL, a simple and powerful programming language used for managing data.   

In addition to SQL, you will discover how Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) allows you to use Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) languages like Python to work with databases. You will gain full-stack Django skills by creating a Django web app to persist, process, and present data. And you will get hands-on experience deploying your Django web app on the cloud.  

Throughout this course you will practice with hands-on labs. You will also complete a final project at the end of the course to demonstrate what you have learnt and have a great addition to your portfolio!

## Final Project: Add a New Assessment Feature to an Online Course App

Welcome to the culmination of your learning journey in this Django course. In this module, you will apply your new skills and knowledge to improve applications in a practice project and a peer-reviewed final project.

### General Notes
An `onlinecourse` app has already been provided in this repo upon which you will be adding a new assesement feature.
- If you want to develop the final project on Theia hosted by [IBM Developer Skills Network](https://labs.cognitiveclass.ai/), you will need to create the same project structure on Theia workspace and save it everytime you close the browser
- Or you could develop the final project locally by setting up your own Python runtime and IDE
- Hints for the final project are left on source code files
- You may choose any cloud platform for deployment (default is IBM Cloud Foundry)
- Depends on your deployment, you may choose any SQL database Django supported such as SQLite3, PostgreSQL, and MySQL (default is SQLite3)

### ER Diagram
For your reference, we have prepared the ER diagram design for the new assesement feature.
